# United States Population Estimates
##2019
This map displays population estimates in America by state in 2019.
It uses proportional symbol styling to help the user extrapolate population density in a given area across the country. The size of the circles are scaled proportionally to the population data, so the larger the circle, the higher the population in a given area. 
A proportional symbol map such as this one is especially useful to indicate the legitimate population of a state. This symbology disallows perception to be influenced by the size of a state. Use of proportional symbol maps emphasize the “land doesn't vote, people do” commentary risen out of the recent election, as the biases introduced by choropleth maps are challenged. A population map like this has many potential applications, including planning, political, economic, and ecological reference.
